## What Is An AI Website Builder?
An AI website builder is, put simply, any website builder that uses artificial intelligence to help in the creation and management of the website. The first AI tool to be made available for website owners was chatbots to answer customer queries, but then in 2016, Wix unveiled its Wix Artificial Design Intelligence (ADI), which could create a custom website template based on answers from a short questionnaire. Now, with language learning models (LLM) like ChatGPT, AI can create custom text based on a short prompt.
<br>An important thing to take away though is this: AI cannot create, it can only copy. AIs learn through being fed loads of data, and their answers will only be as good as their library.<br>
We used our own in-house research teams and hands-on experience to create this list. We pride ourselves on our methodology that we use across all our lists and reviews. For this article, we are ranking by the overall scores for the website builders, not AI-specific scores because we believe you need an all-round great builder, not just a standalone set of good AI tools. We want to be as transparent as possible so you understand where our views come from. This is all so that you make the most informed decision possible when building your website.
